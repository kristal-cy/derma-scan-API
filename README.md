## 📌 Project Description

This project builds a CNN model trained on annotated facial image datasets to classify skin conditions, particularly acne. The deep learning model is expected to recognize acne of various severity levels from facial images. This solution can support dermatologists, skincare applications, and general users in better understanding their skin conditions.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔄 **Image Preprocessing & Augmentation**  
  Includes image resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve model generalization and robustness.

- 🧠 **Custom CNN Architecture**  
  Built with TensorFlow/Keras, the CNN model extracts facial features relevant to acne detection.

- 📊 **Training & Validation Metrics**  
  Visualizes model performance using accuracy/loss graphs and confusion matrices.

- 📱 **Deployment Potential**  
  Ready for integration into mobile/web apps as an AI-based acne detection tool.

## 📊 Model Output Sample
- Validation Accuracy: ~82%
- Training Accuracy: ~90%
- Final Validation Loss: ~3.1
- Final Training Loss: ~2.8
- F1-Score: ~0.89 (based on additional evaluation)
- The confusion matrix shows the model performs well in distinguishing between acne and non-acne facial skin conditions.
